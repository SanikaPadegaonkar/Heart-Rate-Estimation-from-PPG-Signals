**Abstract** \
With the increasing prevalence of smartphones and their enhanced computational capabilities, there is a growing interest in deploying complex tasks on these devices. This paper addresses the challenge of estimating heart rate using smartphones. Traditionally, vital sign estimation algorithms involve multiple pre-processing steps, leading to increased computational complexity and limitations on device compatibility. Leveraging a fully convolutional architecture, our proposed model significantly reduces parameter count, approximately a quarter of conventional architectures employing fully-connected layers for prediction. This not only minimizes the risk of overfitting but also reduces computational complexity. To enhance the model's robustness and applicability, we conducted novel experiments, including the integration of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, training on the BIDMC dataset, and implementing data augmentation techniques. The BIDMC dataset, characterized by its accuracy and substantial data volume, contributes to improved model performance. Additionally, our research introduces a customizable bar graph plotting function for efficient visualization of multiple losses and models. Furthermore, we address the issue of noise in PPG signals by introducing data augmentation, enabling the model to better handle ambient light variations and expanding the dataset with augmented data points. Our proposed LSTM model demonstrates superior convergence speed and comparable performance to previous models. In conclusion, this paper presents an innovative approach to mobile-based heart rate estimation through deep learning, offering a streamlined solution without the need for extensive pre-processing. The provided experimental results, based on a publicly available dataset, showcase state-of-the-art estimation accuracy, making our approach a valuable contribution to the field of non-contact vital sign estimation. \
